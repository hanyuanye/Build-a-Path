# Tetris-Platformer-
Game with two parts, building a path using tetris mechanics and then controlling a sprite to navigate the path towards the objective. 
The player builds a path around various obstacles such as spikes in order to maneuvour a sprite to all the goal tiles. 

The graphics were implemented using the SDL2 library. All code was written independently using git as source control.
